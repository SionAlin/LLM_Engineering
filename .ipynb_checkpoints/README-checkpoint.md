## üß† Project 1 Overview: LLM-Generated Company Brochure

This project automatically generates a **company brochure** using content scraped from its website and enhanced with an LLM (OpenAI or Ollama).

The system performs the following steps:
1. Fetch and parse the target website.
2. Extract relevant pages (About, Contact, Careers).
3. Use a language model to synthesize a professional brochure in Markdown.
4. Display the output in a simple web UI using Gradio.
